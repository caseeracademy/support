2. **Archive** is for historical reference only
3. **README.md** in root should always be the entry point
4. Link to specific docs from README when relevant

### Adding New Documentation

```bash
# Add to docs/ folder
touch docs/NEW_FEATURE.md

# Update docs/README.md to include link
# Update root README.md if it's a major feature
```
