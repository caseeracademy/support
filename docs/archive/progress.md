## 📝 Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **No WhatsApp Integration** - Simplified to focus on tickets and students
2. **SQLite for Development** - Easy setup, can switch to MySQL for production
3. **API-Driven Students** - No local student database, fetches from main site
4. **Guest Order Support** - Handles anonymous checkouts
5. **Metadata Tracking** - Stores WordPress user IDs and order sources

### Production Considerations
- Switch to MySQL/PostgreSQL for better performance
- Set up proper authentication for API endpoints
- Configure email notifications
- Set up automated backups
- Monitor webhook failures
- Rate limiting for API calls

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### ngrok (Development)
```bash
ngrok http 8000
# Update main website webhook URL to ngrok URL
```

### Production
1. Deploy to server (Laravel Forge, Vapor, etc.)
2. Configure domain and SSL
3. Update webhook URL on main website
4. Set up cron for scheduled tasks
5. Configure proper database

## 🔧 Recent Updates (October 12, 2025)

### API Error Handling System
Added comprehensive error handling for all Caseer Academy API interactions:

**What it does:**
- Detects authentication errors (401, 403) vs general API errors
- Shows persistent notifications with detailed error messages
- Includes "Go to Settings" button for quick access to fix credentials
- Works on all Student Management pages (list, search, create, details, password reset)

**How it works:**
1. `CaseerAcademyService` adds `is_auth_error` flag to all responses
2. Helper method `showApiErrorNotification()` formats user-friendly notifications
3. Notifications are persistent (don't auto-hide) until user dismisses them
4. Error messages include emoji indicators (🔒 for auth, ⚠️ for general errors)

**Example Error Flow:**
1. User enters wrong API key in Settings
2. Goes to Students page
3. Sees persistent red notification: "**Authentication failed!** Please check your API Secret Key..."
4. Clicks "Go to Settings" button
5. Updates API key
6. Clicks "Test Connection" to verify
7. Returns to Students - everything works!

**Files Updated:**
- `app/Services/CaseerAcademyService.php` - Added error detection methods
- `app/Filament/Resources/StudentResource/Pages/ListStudents.php` - Added error notification helper
- `app/Filament/Resources/StudentResource/Pages/CreateStudent.php` - Added error notification helper
- `app/Filament/Resources/StudentResource/Pages/StudentDetails.php` - Added error notification helper
- `app/Filament/Resources/StudentResource.php` - Added error notification helper for table actions
