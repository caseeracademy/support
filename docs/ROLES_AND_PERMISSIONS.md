## 🔧 Implementation

### Employee Creation with Login
When creating an employee, you can optionally create a login account:

1. **Go to HR & Payroll → Employees**
2. **Click "Create"**
3. **Fill in employee details**
4. **In "Login Credentials & Role" section:**
   - Toggle "Create Login Account" ON
   - Enter username (e.g., "john.doe")
   - Enter password (minimum 8 characters)
   - Confirm password
   - Select role (Admin, Accounting, Sales, etc.)
5. **Click "Create"**

The system will:
- Create the employee record
- Create user account with email: username@company.com
- Assign selected role
- Grant appropriate permissions

---

## 🎛️ Permission Control Strategy

### Resource-Level Authorization
Resources can be protected by checking permissions in the resource class:

```php
public static function canViewAny(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasPermission('employee.view');
}

public static function canCreate(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasPermission('employee.create');
}

public static function canEdit(Model $record): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasPermission('employee.edit');
}

public static function canDelete(Model $record): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasPermission('employee.delete');
}
```

### Action-Level Authorization
Specific actions can be protected:

```php
Tables\Actions\Action::make('approve')
    ->visible(fn () => auth()->user()->hasPermission('payroll.approve'))
```

### Page-Level Authorization
Filament pages can be protected:

```php
public static function canAccess(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasPermission('finance.reports');
}
```

### Widget-Level Authorization
Widgets can be shown/hidden based on permissions:

```php
public static function canView(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasRole(['admin', 'accounting']);
}
```

## 🔄 Managing Roles & Permissions

### Assign Role to User
```php
$user = User::find(1);
$user->assignRole('accounting');

// Or multiple roles
$user->syncRoles([Role::find(2)->id, Role::find(3)->id]);
```

### Check Permissions
```php
// Check if user has specific permission
if (auth()->user()->hasPermission('finance.approve')) {
    // User can approve transactions
}

// Check if user has role
if (auth()->user()->hasRole('admin')) {
    // User is admin
}

// Check if user is admin
if (auth()->user()->isAdmin()) {
    // User is admin
}
```

### Add Permission to Role
```php
$role = Role::where('name', 'accounting')->first();
$role->givePermissionTo('new.permission');

// Or multiple
$role->syncPermissions([1, 2, 3, 4]);
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### 1. Default Deny
All resources should deny access by default and explicitly grant permissions:
```php
public static function canViewAny(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->isAdmin() || 
           auth()->user()->hasPermission('resource.view');
}
```

### 2. Sensitive Actions
Critical actions should require specific permissions:
```php
Tables\Actions\DeleteAction::make()
    ->visible(fn () => auth()->user()->hasPermission('employee.delete'))
```

### 3. Data Isolation
Some roles should only see their own data:
```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    $query = parent::getEloquentQuery();
    
    if (! auth()->user()->isAdmin()) {
        $query->where('department', auth()->user()->employee->department);
    }
    
    return $query;
}
```

### 4. Audit Logging
Track who performs sensitive actions:
```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeCreate(array $data): array
{
    $data['created_by'] = auth()->id();
    return $data;
}
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Roles Already Created
7 default roles are seeded:
- Administrator
- Accounting
- Sales
- Marketing
- Human Resources
- Support Agent
- Viewer

### 2. Permissions Already Assigned
45+ permissions across 9 groups

### 3. Ready to Use
When creating employees, just:
1. Enable "Create Login Account"
2. Enter username and password
3. Select appropriate role
4. System handles the rest!

---

## 📊 Permission Tracking

### View All Roles
```php
Role::with('permissions')->get();
```

### View User Permissions
```php
$user = User::with('roles.permissions')->find(1);
$permissions = $user->roles->flatMap->permissions->unique('id');
```

### Audit User Access
```php
// Get all permissions for a user
$user->roles()->with('permissions')->get()
    ->flatMap->permissions
    ->unique('id')
    ->pluck('display_name');
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Add New Role
```bash
Role::create([
    'name' => 'custom_role',
    'display_name' => 'Custom Role',
    'description' => 'Custom permissions',
    'color' => '#FF5733',
]);
```

### Add New Permission
```bash
Permission::create([
    'name' => 'module.action',
    'display_name' => 'Action Description',
    'group' => 'module',
]);

// Assign to role
$role->givePermissionTo('module.action');
```

### Modify Role Permissions
1. Find the role in database or code
2. Add/remove permissions as needed
3. Users with that role get updated permissions immediately

---

## 🔍 Testing Permissions

### Check What a User Can Do
```php
$user = User::find(1);

echo "Roles: " . $user->role_names;

$user->roles->each(function ($role) {
    echo "\nRole: {$role->display_name}";
    echo "\nPermissions:";
    $role->permissions->each(function ($permission) {
        echo "\n  - {$permission->display_name}";
    });
});
```

### Test Permission Gates
```php
// In Tinker or tests
$user = User::find(1);
$user->hasPermission('finance.approve'); // true/false
$user->hasRole('accounting'); // true/false
$user->isAdmin(); // true/false
```

## 💡 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Accountant
1. Create employee with Accounting role
2. They can access: Finances, Invoices, Budgets, Payroll
3. They cannot access: HR, System Settings

### Scenario 2: Support Agent
1. Create employee with Support Agent role
2. They can access: Tickets, Customers
3. They cannot access: Finances, Payroll, HR

### Scenario 3: Manager (Multiple Roles)
1. Create employee
2. Assign multiple roles if needed:
   ```php
   $user->assignRole('sales');
   $user->assignRole('marketing');
   ```
3. They get combined permissions from both roles

## ⚙️ Future Enhancements

The system is designed to support:

### 1. Department-Level Permissions
```php
// Only see data from your department
if (! auth()->user()->isAdmin()) {
    $query->where('department', auth()->user()->employee->department);
}
```

### 2. Custom Permissions Per User
```php
// Create user_permission table for individual overrides
$user->giveDirectPermission('special.feature');
```

### 3. Permission Inheritance
```php
// Junior roles inherit from senior roles
$salesManager->inheritsFrom($salesAgent);
```

### 4. Time-Based Permissions
```php
// Permissions that expire
$permission->expiresAt(now()->addMonths(3));
```

## 📝 Role Assignment Examples

### During Employee Creation
- Fill in employee details
- Toggle "Create Login Account" = ON
- Enter username: "john.smith"
- Enter password: "securepass123"
- Select role: "Accounting"
- System creates: john.smith@company.com with Accounting permissions

### After Employee Exists
1. Edit employee record
2. Click "Create Login" button
3. Enter credentials and select role
4. Or click "Manage Login" to edit existing user

### Bulk Role Assignment
```php
// Assign all sales employees to Sales role
Employee::where('department', 'Sales')
    ->whereNotNull('user_id')
    ->get()
    ->each(function ($employee) {
        $employee->user->assignRole('sales');
    });
```

## 🎯 Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Apply to Resources (Future Enhancement)
Add authorization methods to each resource:

// In TransactionResource.php
public static function canViewAny(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasAnyPermission([
        'finance.view',
        'finance.create',
        'finance.edit',
    ]);
}
```

### 2. Apply to Actions (Future Enhancement)
Protect sensitive actions:
```php
Tables\Actions\DeleteAction::make()
    ->authorize('delete')
```

### 3. Apply to Widgets (Future Enhancement)
Show/hide widgets based on roles:
```php
public static function canView(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->hasRole(['admin', 'accounting']);
}
```

## 📞 Support

### Check User's Roles
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = User::find(1);
>>> $user->roles;
>>> $user->role_names;
```

### Check Role's Permissions
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> $role = Role::where('name', 'accounting')->first();
>>> $role->permissions;
```

### Re-seed Roles/Permissions
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=RolePermissionSeeder
```

---

**The permission system is now ready to use!**

Employees can be created with login credentials and assigned appropriate roles that determine their access throughout the system.
