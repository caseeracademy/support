# Employee Login & Access Information

## üîë Login Route

**All employees login at the same route: `/admin`**

Currently, all employees with system access log in to the **Filament Admin Panel** at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```

## üë• Current Employee Accounts

All employees use the same login page, but each has a different **role** that determines what they can access:

| Employee | Email | Password | Role | Can Access |
|----------|-------|----------|------|------------|
| Sarah Johnson | sarah.johnson@company.com | password | HR | All modules |
| Michael Chen | michael.chen@company.com | password | Accounting | Financial modules |
| Emma Rodriguez | emma.rodriguez@company.com | password | Sales | Tickets & Customers |
| David Kim | david.kim@company.com | password | Support | Tickets only |
| Sophie Williams | sophie.williams@company.com | password | Marketing | Reports & View data |
| Admin | admin@example.com | password | Admin | Everything |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Access Control Status

**Currently: NO ROLE-BASED RESTRICTIONS**

Right now, all employees can see **all sections** in the admin panel after logging in. The roles are stored in the database but are not yet restricting access to resources.

### What We Need to Implement

To make the role-based access control work properly, we need to create **Laravel Policies** for each resource that check the user's role before allowing access.

For example:
- **HR role** should only see HR & Payroll sections
- **Accounting role** should only see Finance & Transactions sections
- **Support role** should only see Tickets & Customers
- **Marketing** should see Reports but not edit transactions
- **Viewer** should only see read-only dashboards

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Add Simple Authorization (Quick)
Add `shouldRegisterNavigation()` methods to each resource to hide menu items based on role.

### Option 2: Full Policy-Based Authorization (Recommended)
Create Laravel Policies for each model (Employee, Transaction, Ticket, etc.) that check user roles.

### Option 3: Separate Employee Portal (Advanced)
Create a second Filament panel at `/employee` with limited access for employees, keeping `/admin` for full administrators only.

## üí° Current Feature: Salary-Role Connection

The system already shows **salary recommendations** based on role when creating/editing employees:

- **Admin**: $60k-$120k+
- **HR**: $40k-$80k
- **Accounting**: $50k-$90k
- **Sales**: $40k-$100k
- **Marketing**: $45k-$85k
- **Support**: $35k-$60k
- **Viewer**: $30k-$50k

This helps ensure employees are paid appropriately for their role and responsibilities.

## üîê How Login Works Now

1. Employee goes to `/admin/login`
2. Enters email and password
3. System authenticates them
4. All employees see the full dashboard (no restrictions yet)
5. They can access all resources (this needs to be fixed)

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Working

‚úÖ Employee accounts are created and linked to users  
‚úÖ Roles are assigned correctly  
‚úÖ Login authentication works  
‚úÖ Employee form shows salary-role recommendations  
‚úÖ HR dashboard widget shows employee stats  
‚úÖ Employee-employee relationships (manager/subordinate) work  

## üîß What Needs Work

‚ùå Role-based access control (everyone sees everything)  
‚ùå Resource authorization based on role  
‚ùå Hide sections from unauthorized roles  
‚ùå Prevent unauthorized edits/deletes  

Would you like me to implement role-based authorization so each employee only sees what they should have access to?
